When you copy this over, note that the code we have given you is to help you. We want you to be successful in writing out your own code, so please make sure to edit this a lot, make multiple commits (more than 20), and even note in your own ReadMes that the instructional staff helped by giving you some starter code. We want to keep you all from getting flagged for plagiarism. Thanks!
